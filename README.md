# Project
Cub3D is one of the three project in the 42 program fifth circle. This is a group project of the 42 common core program. In this project the students need to create a raycaster to display custom maps.

# Involved Language(s)
* <img alt="C_Logo" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/archive/3/35/20220802133510%21The_C_Programming_Language_logo.svg/120px-The_C_Programming_Language_logo.svg.png" style="height : 50px;"/>

# Constraints
According to the subject there only three constraint for this project:
* The whole files of the projects need to follow 42 norm ([Link](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf))
* The project must be realized using the minilibx ([Link](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42))

# External Functions Allowed

This project don't allow any external library.
* open
* close
* read
* write
* printf
* malloc
* free
* perror
* strerror
* exit
* All functions of the math library (*-lm man man 3 math*)

# Project breakdown
For this project we didn't splited the workload in distinct parts, both of us worked on everything.
* Co-Worker : [ParesseuxRose](https://github.com/ParesseuxRose)

# Group choices

We've taken a small liberty with the subject:
* We have chosen to have "square" by "square" movement in our labyrinth, inspired by the *[Legend of Grimrock](https://store.steampowered.com/app/207170/Legend_of_Grimrock/)* movement system rather than a more classic movement system.
